# .dotfiles

I manage my dotfiles with [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). Also see [here](https://github.com/jaskaransarkaria/.dotfiles).

- `mkrc -v <path to file or directory>` - add to .dotfiles with symlink
- `rcup` - updates all the dotfiles
- `rcdn <filename>` - removes the symlink

Note: This repo must remain PRIVATE untill the npm token (which is commited in npmrc) is cycled.
